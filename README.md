# Shared bookmarks
Chrome extension for saving bookmarks & backend service for sharing bookmark data with other users.

## Why?

I tend to bookmark many pages, but when I need to find that thing again, I cannot remember what page was or what was the title. Having tags in bookmarks allows me to search for bookmarks having tags.
